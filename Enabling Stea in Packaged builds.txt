Enabling Steam In Packaged Builds

As of unreal version 4.21, the steps described in the previous and next lecture allow you to connect via Steam old when:

    Playing as "Standalone"

    or launching the game via CMD / Powershell, etc.

It does not work when you package the game for shipping.

The workaround for this is simple. When you package the game,

    Go to the packaged game folder [YourGameName]/Binaries/Win64 (or other platform)

    In this folder create a file called steam_appid.txt. Inside this file just write your app id (480 if you are using the public one for testing)

Now it should work. You can check by opening the executable. The Steam overlay should popup.


Thanks Gustavo for pointing this out.
