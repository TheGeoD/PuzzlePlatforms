Bugs In Steam OSS

You may notice some bugs in the Steam OSS while taking this course. One notable one is that the number of players in a session does not increase. 
This is normal and actually that functionality doesn't work in modern version of the editor.

To get around this you could:

    Track this information manually and update the session settings with IOnlineSession::UpdateSession.

    Use plugins that help aleviate this issue: Advanced Sessions Plugin or UWorks (some are paid).
